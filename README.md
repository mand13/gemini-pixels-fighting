# gemini-pixels-fighting
This is a pixels fighting game that I created using almost exclusively Gemini code generation. I've prompted it to add many features including some percent control statistics and plots of team control over time.

TODO:
monte-carlo.py hasn't been updated. It could be updated to track many extra stats that would be interesting to analyze like each team's min and max percents (maybe all percents if not too expensive?)
